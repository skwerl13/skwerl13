- 👋 Hi, I’m @rebl76!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to not waste my time. 😁

I want to create a community-developed, WebKit-based browser with limited telemetry in the future. I want it to be compatible with Firefox extensions, but have a more fluid/clean UI than both Firefox or Chromium-based browsers. I hope to make it compatible with the Gemini protocol as well. In a few years you might be able to help out!

I also want to create a telemetry-free alternative to Google Fonts so that web developers don't have to rely on Google to give their sites personality.
