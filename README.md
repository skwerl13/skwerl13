- 👋 Hi, I’m @tornadodobird!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything I can!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to not waste my time. 😁

I want to create a company that makes Linux laptops, desktops, All-In-Ones and Smartphones with powerful RISC-V processors. I want it to have a macOS Rosetta-like emulator layer to make x86 packages compatible before they are ported for RISC-V architectures. I won't reinvent the wheel - I'll make it better by making a Linux alternative to Big Tech-owned devices that people already know how to use. I hope to make devices that are the same quality as Apple machines, but ones that will get software updates as long as they can run and you have the right to repair and tinker with.
